= Combination of Authlogic Example App and Remi's Rack-OAuth

This is an example of how to use Authlogic in a rails app. Authlogic is a clean, simple, and unobtrusive ruby authentication solution.

* Ben Johnson's Authlogic-Example lives at: http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic_example with the gem at: http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic
* Remi's Rack Oauth lives at: http://github.com/remi/rack-oauth with a screencast available at http://remi.org/

== Deployable to Heroku
This app is deployable to Heroku with a few small caveats:
* No file uploads work (obviously)
* Twitter app needs to be changed to match the URL
* Google Maps API needs to be changed to match the URL
* BIG: Heroku doesn't seem to migrate the Sessions Table, so I have to load the DB locally in the app first, then push the DB to heroku after the first deploy, then it should work
